<sup>The hosted app at <a href="https://app.tryquickdraw.com">app.tryquickdraw.com</a> — the same board <code>createQuickdraw()</code> drops into your page.</sup>

Quickdraw exists because embedding a whiteboard shouldn't cost thousands of
dollars a year. Quickdraw is MIT: no license key, no fees, no strings. A small
"Made with Quickdraw" badge sits in the board's corner by default; keeping it
helps people find the project, and turning it off is free, legal, and one line
— `watermark: false`, no license key, no signup, no phone-home. We just
appreciate the credit.

## About this fork

This is a fork of [quickdrawjs/quickdraw](https://github.com/quickdrawjs/quickdraw)
that pulls the editor closer to tldraw's feel. On top of the upstream engine
it adds:

- **Image cropping** — double-click an image, trim the window, slide the picture behind it
- **Groups** — `⌘G` / `⇧⌘G`, click a member to select the group, double-click to dive in
- **Arrow bindings** — arrows and lines tie to shapes and follow them; ends sit on the outline
- **Alignment and distribution**, and one-step **ordering** (`]` / `[`, `⇧` for all the way)
- **Context menu** on right-click and touch long-press, with Reorder and Align flyouts
- **Drag tools off the dock** onto the board to drop a ready-made shape
- **SVG export** alongside PNG, from the menus, the API, and the React Native bridge
- **tldraw-style transforms** — rotate from the corners with a mouse (the knob stays for touch),
  resize rotated shapes in their own frame, `⌥` to resize about the centre, `⌥` as a live
  copy toggle while dragging, and pressing inside hollow shapes or groups to move them
- **Paste from tldraw** — shapes, ink, notes, arrows with bindings, images with crops, frames,
  groups, and formatted text (bold, italic, highlight, links…) come across, images included
- **Marked text and links** — bold / italic / underline / strike / code / highlight / link runs
  on text, notes and labels, plus a link badge for shapes that link somewhere
- The **pointer** is the default tool

- **tldraw's fonts** — Shantell Sans and IBM Plex, self-hosted (SIL Open Font License):
  `import '@quickdrawjs/core/fonts.css'` next to the stylesheet

Everything is still zero-dependency ESM; the two codecs tldraw's clipboard
relies on (lz-string, its Float16 stroke paths) are ported inline. See the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the details.

## What you get

A simple, joyful drawing experience:

- **Pressure ink** — a freehand pen whose width breathes with stylus pressure,
  or with velocity for mouse users; strokes taper like a real pen
- **Highlighter** that soaks into the paper (and glows on dark boards)
- **Shapes** — rectangle, ellipse, triangle, diamond, hexagon, star, cloud — with a
  seeded hand-drawn wobble, four fill styles, and editable labels
- **Arrows** with draggable bend, lines, text, sticky notes
- **Images** — paste, drag-drop, or pick; auto-downscaled and stored in-document
- **Laser pointer** for presenting (ephemeral, never saved)
- **Selection** — click, shift-click, marquee; move, resize, rotate, duplicate,
  reorder; full keyboard nudging
- **Infinite canvas** — pan, wheel zoom, two-finger pinch, zoom-to-fit
- **Palm rejection** — once a stylus is seen, fingers steer the camera and the
  pen draws
- **Undo/redo** — one entry per gesture, however many events it took
- **Light & dark themes**, twelve named colors that resolve per theme, and a
  theme switch built into the board menu
- **Grid backdrops** — plain, ruled lines, notebook rules, dots, crosses
  (blueprint), and isometric; default is `lines`; spacing adapts to the zoom
  and fades in rather than popping
- **Arrows that bind** — draw from a shape to a shape and the arrow follows them
- **Paste from tldraw** — shapes, ink, notes, arrows, images, and formatted text come across as-is
- **PNG & SVG export** — whole board or selection, on paper or transparent
- **A responsive floating toolbar** that sheds tools gracefully as the frame
  narrows — or hide it and build your own from the headless API
- **Real-time sync built into the data model** — every change emits a
  JSON-safe diff you can ship over any transport

Zero runtime dependencies. The core is plain ESM that runs in any modern
browser without a build step.

## Packages

| Package | For | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@quickdrawjs/core`](packages/core) | Any web page or framework | framework-free engine + toolbar |
| [`@quickdrawjs/react`](packages/react) | React apps | `<Quickdraw />` component + hooks |
| [`@quickdrawjs/react-native`](packages/react-native) | React Native / Expo apps | WebView component + typed bridge |

## Quick start — React

```bash
npm install @quickdrawjs/react
```

```jsx
import { Quickdraw } from '@quickdrawjs/react'
import '@quickdrawjs/core/quickdraw.css'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ position: 'fixed', inset: 0 }}>
      <Quickdraw theme="light" grid="lines" watermark={false} />
      {/* the "Made with Quickdraw" badge is on by default;
          watermark={false} removes it — free, no strings */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Persistence, imperative control, custom chrome:

```jsx
const ref = useRef(null)

<Quickdraw
  ref={ref}
  snapshot={saved}                          // load a serialized document
  autoFit                                   // fit content on mount/resize
  onChange={(diff, source, editor) =>       // every document change
    save(editor.store.getSnapshot())}
  onSave={(blob) => upload(blob)}           // intercept toolbar PNG export
/>

ref.current.editor.setTool('draw')
ref.current.editor.store.undo()
```

## Quick start — plain JS

```bash
npm install @quickdrawjs/core
```

```js
import { createQuickdraw } from '@quickdrawjs/core'
import '@quickdrawjs/core/quickdraw.css'

const board = createQuickdraw({ container: document.getElementById('board') })
board.editor.store.listen((diff) => console.log('changed', diff))
```

## Quick start — React Native

```bash
npm install @quickdrawjs/react-native react-native-webview
```

```jsx
import { Quickdraw } from '@quickdrawjs/react-native'

<Quickdraw
  ref={board}
  theme="dark"
  onChange={(diff) => sync(diff)}
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
/>

// const snapshot = await board.current.getSnapshot()
// const png = await board.current.exportPng({ scale: 2 })
```

The engine ships inside the package as a single self-contained HTML string —
no network, works offline, Apple Pencil pressure and palm rejection included.

## The data model

The document is a flat map of immutable records. Every mutation happens in a
transaction and emits a diff:

```js
{ added: { [id]: record }, removed: { [id]: record }, updated: { [id]: [from, to] } }
```

That one shape powers everything:

- **Persistence** — `store.getSnapshot()` / `store.loadSnapshot(snap)` are
  plain JSON round-trips
- **Sync** — ship user diffs to peers, `store.applyDiff(diff, 'remote')` on
  arrival; remote diffs never pollute local undo history, so collaborative
  undo behaves
- **History** — undo entries are diffs, composed per gesture; `invertDiff` and
  `composeDiff` are exported
- **Audit / recording** — log the diff stream and you can replay a drawing
  stroke by stroke

```js
// a complete sync client
store.listen((diff) => socket.send(JSON.stringify(diff)), { source: 'user' })
socket.onmessage = (e) => store.applyDiff(JSON.parse(e.data), 'remote')
```

## Roadmap — and what's honestly missing today

Quickdraw is young. What it doesn't have yet: a first-party multiplayer
server (the diff-based store is sync-ready — you bring the transport),
layers, frames, or rich text. The full roadmap lives in
[issue #1](https://github.com/quickdrawjs/quickdraw/issues/1) — comment there
if the missing feature that sent you back to a paid SDK is on it (or isn't).
